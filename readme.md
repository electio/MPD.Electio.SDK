#MPD.Electio.SDK

This repository contains the .NET SDK for Electio. This consists of two separate projects:

##MPD.Electio.SDK.DataTypes

This project contains all the data contracts used by the Electio API represented as C# classes. 

This package is published on Nuget.org and can be installed with the command:

`install-package MPD.Electio.SDK.DataTypes`

This package is referenced by MPD.Electio.SDK, but you do not require a reference to the SDK in order to use the DataTypes only.

##MPD.Electio.SDK

This is the main C# SDK project and contains helper classes and services to allow you to interact with the Electio API easily.

This package is published on Nuget.org and can be installed with the command:

`install-package MPD.Electio.SDK`
